# BookStore Assignment

### Angular v19.1.7.

### Startup project - How to get up and running

- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- For running local with mock data use `npm start`, and open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.
- We use [ng-apimock](http://localhost:3001/mocking/#/) for mocking scenarios which can be accessed at `http://localhost:3001/mocking/#/`.
- For running the tests use `npm test`.

# üìö BookStore Assignment:

### Introduction

## Assignment Details

- **Estimated Time:** Spend no more than 3‚Äì4 hours. We don‚Äôt want you to invest too much time.
- **Focus Areas:** We recommend primarily focusing on User Stories #1, #4, and #5, as well as testing the application.
- **Stories & Acceptance Criteria:** All user stories and requirements are outlined in the project‚Äôs `README.md`.
- **Submission:** Please fork the assignment and send a mail return with a link to your repository solution.
- **Confirmation:** Please confirm receipt of this assignment so we know you‚Äôre ready to begin.

---

## Important Points

- Ensure correct **form validation** throughout the application.
- Make the UI **user-friendly** with tooltips, error messages, and clear visual indicators.
- Use openapis generated models and services **openapi/generated**, and ng-apimock for mocking the backend.
- Provide **tests** for your solution so we can see your approach to quality assurance.
- Follow **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for architecture, documentation, and other guidelines (structured code, reusable components, etc.).
- The project should run **locally**‚Äîinclude a brief description in your own README if anything special is required.
- We will review your solution during the interview, giving you a chance to explain your decisions and discuss any enhancements you would make with more time.

---

## Project Setup

- Follow the instructions in [Startup project](#Startup-project---How-to-get-up-and-running) to install and launch the project locally.
- Test the application to ensure it runs as expected. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out.
- Familiarize yourself with [@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/typescript/) and [ng-mocks](https://ngapimock.org/docs/mocks).

---

## Troubleshooting

## Installing @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli.

Reason: for MacOS + Sequoia with ARM => sepcific java version 11 must be installed.
Fix: followed docs -> https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation#jar

For Mac users, please make sure Java 11 is installed (Tips: run java -version to check the version), and export JAVA_HOME in order to use the supported Java version:

```
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.11`
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH
```

## running unit test

Error: `Data path "/assets/0" must be string.`
The error suggests that the Angular CLI (or the underlying tool chain) is expecting a string at index 0 of the assets array, but it found an object instead.
Fix:

```
 "styles": [
    "src/styles.scss"
  ],
```

## What We‚Äôre Looking For

- **Coding Standards**: Your code doesn‚Äôt have to be **perfect**, but we value **good structure**, **reusability**, and **clean code**.
  - Read more about [coding standards](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Quality Assurance:** We appreciate **unit tests** and **end-to-end tests** to ensure our solutions works as expected.
  - Unit tests should cover **critical parts** of the application.
    - **Jest** for unit tests.
  - End-to-end tests should cover **user flows** and **edge cases**. (_Not required, but a bonus_)
    - **Cypress** or **Playwright** for end-to-end tests. Use `ng e2e` to add the wished test framework.
- **Documentation:** You can include a short **README** detailing your approach and/or if any steps needs to be followed.
